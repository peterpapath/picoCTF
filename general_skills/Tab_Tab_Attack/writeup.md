# ANALYSH
In this challenge we need to find a flag inside a file.  
  

# SOLUTION
The problem is that to get to this file we need to pass all lot of directories. Inside of a shell, we can use **Tab** to auto-complete the name of a command, a directory or a file. This way, we get to the flag file much easier.  
  

* Flag: picoCTF{l3v3l_up!_t4k3_4_r35t!_a00cae70}
