# ANALYSIS
For this challenge, we need to connect to a remote server with a netcat command given.  
  

# SOLUTION
After we connect, we see several numbers that represent ascii characters. With an [online decoder](https://codebeautify.org/ascii-to-text
) we can get the flag.  
    

* Flag: picoCTF{g00d_k1tty!_n1c3_k1tty!_7c0821f5}
