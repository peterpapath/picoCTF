# ANALYSIS
To get the flag in this chalenge we have to correct the given rust code.  
  

# SOLUTION
Firstly, we need to add a question mark in end of the `let key` command.  
Then, we have to change the return command, from `ret` to `return`.  
We also need to change the way a variable is printed.
  

In the end, we navigate to the folder that contais the Cargo files and we run the program with the command `cargo run`.
