# ANALYSIS
This challenge is running on a web server, which takes us to a webpage. From the challenge description, we notice that we have to use the server API.  
  

# SOLUTION
After getting to the page, we see that there is an open API documentation.
From the description we are asked to create a file with the API. This can be found in the diagnostics category, the `/headump`. This way, we create a file just by executing this request and we get the dump, where the flag is located.
