# ANALYSIS
This challenge runs on a webserver, where you we can announce a message. From the challenge name, we can assume that we have to do Server Side Template Injection.

# SOLUTION
First of all, we have to find out what template service is running on the server. After some analysis we come to the conclusion that it is ***jinja***. Then, just from googling we found out that there is an opportunity of remote command execution (RCE).
